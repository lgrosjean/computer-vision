# Mask_RCNN for Objet Detection and Segmentation

This is an implementation of Mask R-CNN on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 backbone.

The repo from which I pulled the code is https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN.

I don't use the `coco/PythonAPI` because of incompatibily but all the required functions and package are present.

This is the image I tested :

![hajar_input](images/hajar.jpg)

And this is the result I got :
![hajar_output](outputs/hajar_output.jpg)
